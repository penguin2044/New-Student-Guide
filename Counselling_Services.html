				<h2>Counselling Services</h2>
				<p>
					Counselling Services at RRC Polytech are designed to help students
					manage personal, emotional, and academic challenges. Whether you're
					dealing with stress, anxiety, relationship issues, or academic
					pressure, the service offers personalized one-on-one sessions,
					workshops, and resources to support mental health and personal growth.
				</p>

				<h3>What do you gain from services?</h3>
				<p class="ref">
					Counseling Services at RRC Polytech utilizes several key communication
					strategies to support student’s mental well-being. Active listening
					creates a safe environment where students can express their concerns
					without judgment, while empathy helps counselors understand the
					student's emotional states, fostering a compassionate and very
					supportive atmosphere. Reading body language and facial expressions,
					strengthens support and trust between counselors and students. Through
					clarity and conciseness, counselors provide clear guidance on mental
					health resources and coping strategies, ensuring students understand
					the steps needed to improve their well-being. Feedback plays a crucial
					role as counselors offer constructive input on how students navigate
					personal challenges, build strength and manage interpersonal issues.
					Finally, interpersonal communication is at the core of counselling, as
					one-on-one sessions provide a platform for open and meaningful
					dialogue between students and counselors, reinforcing trust and
					understanding.
